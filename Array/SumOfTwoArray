Two random integer arrays/lists have been given as ARR1 and ARR2 of size N and M respectively. Both the arrays/lists contain numbers from 0 to 9(i.e. single digit integer is present at every index). The idea here is to represent each array/list as an integer in itself of digits N and M.
You need to find the sum of both the input arrays/list treating them as two integers and put the result in another array/list i.e. output array/list will also contain only single digit at every index.

vector <int> sumofarr(vector<int> arr1 , vector<int> arr2){


    //Converting first array to int

   reverse(arr1.begin(), arr1.end());
    int decimal1 = 1;
    int num1 = 0;
    for (auto& it : arr1)
    {
    num1 += it * decimal1;
    decimal1 = 10;
    }

    //Converting second array to int

    reverse(arr2.begin(), arr2.end());
    int decimal2 = 1;
    int num2 = 0;
    for (auto& it : arr2)
    {
    num2 += it decimal2;
    decimal2 *= 10;
    }

    int res = num1 + num2;

    //integer to array
    int rem;
    vector<int> result;
    while(res != 0){
        rem = res%10;
        result.push_back(rem);
        res /= 10;
    }

    //reversing the array(vector)
    reverse(result.begin(), result.end());
    return result;
